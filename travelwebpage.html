        <h3> Rivers</h3>
        <p> <p id="rivers">There are four main rivers in Latvia: <em>Daugava, Gauja, Lielupe, Venta.</em> </p>
       <p> <p id="description"> <strong>The Daugava</strong> is a large river rising in the Valdai Hills of Russia that flows through Belarus then Latvia into the Gulf of Riga of the Baltic Sea.<br>
        <strong>The Gauja River</strong> is a river in the Vidzeme region of Latvia. It is the only large river of Latvia that begins and ends its flow in Latvia. Its length is 460 km, of which 1/5 or 93.5 km are in the Gauja National Park. In this part, the Gauja River flows through a spacious ancient Gauja valley, which is 1 to 2.5 km wide, and the maximum depth near Sigulda is 85 m. Thus, in essence, Gauja is the longest river of Latvia when we count only the parts of the river in the country's territory. Daugava has only 367 km in Latvia, while the whole river is over 1000 km. <br>
        <strong>The Lielupe</strong> begins at the confluence of the Mēmele and Mūsa rivers near Bauska. For the upper part of its course, the river flows through a dolomite valley with a few small rapids, until it reaches Mežotne, where it widens and deepens over the flat Zemgale Plain.<br>
        <strong>The Venta</strong> is a river in north-western Lithuania and western Latvia. Its source is near Kuršėnai in the Lithuanian Šiauliai County. It flows into the Baltic Sea at Ventspils in Latvia.Venta has the widest waterfall in Europe — Venta Rapid. </p>

        <h3>Lakes</h3>
        <p> There are more than 3000 lakes in Latvia. The biggest is Lubāns and the deapest is Drīdzis. Both of them are in Latgale which is called the Land of the Lakes. If you want to have a rest near the water, go to Latgale, rent a guesthouse and have a peaceful time near the lake. Latgalians are very hospitable people and they will offer you different attractions: fishing, boat trips, tasting national dishes and home made beer and shmakovka.</p>

        <h3> Mountain Gaiziņš</h3>
        <p> The Gaising or Gaiziņkalns, at 312 m (1,024 feet) above sea level, is the highest point in Latvia. It is situated in the Vidzeme Upland a short distance to the west of the town of Madona, central Vidzeme. Although only relatively low, Gaiziņkalns has been developed into a skiing area with three slopes and several guesthouses. If you like skiing, you have to come to Latvia in winter. Let's try skiinig on Gaiziņš and have a rest in one of the guesthouse, enjoy winter evenings, drink tea from natural plants and taste Latvian homemade biscuits. </p>

        <h3> The Baltic Sea coast</h3>
        <p> The shores of the Baltic Sea in Latvia are almost 500 km long. The Kurzeme coast is washed by mighty waves from the open sea that, up north at Cape Kolka, meet the calmer waters of the Gulf of Riga, where the most popular stretches are the white sandy beaches at Riga and Jurmala, and the rocky beaches of Vidzeme.<br>

Latvia’s lengthy coastline never ceases to surprise with its dunes, steep cliffs, sandstone outcrops, impressive rocks and caverns.<br>

The coastline owes much of its charm to the fishing villages, the multiple areas untouched by civilisation, imposing port cities, and the popular resort city of Jurmala.<br>
Let's try and enjoy one of the long-distance hiking trails along the coast of the Baltic Sea. </p>
